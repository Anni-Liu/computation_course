Throughout the course, we'll be using [Python Fundamentals](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-fundamentals/9780135917411/) by Paul J. Deitel and [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and The Cloud](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/intro-to-python/9780135404799/) by Paul J. Deitel & Harvey Deitel as our reference materials. Both items cover the same material - Python Fundamentals are video lectures and Intro to Pythonâ€¦ is a book. The videos are the primary version for this course.

Both items are on [O'Reilly Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/) . You have __free__ access to all of O'Reilly Learning through the University of San Francisco single sign-on (SSO). O'Reilly Learning contains technical books and videos on pretty much every technical subject. O'Reilly Learning will be an invaluable resource throughout the MSDS program.
