<center><h2>Setting-up an Development Environment sucks</h2></center>
 
When you start working as a Data Scientist it can take more than a __full__ day to setup a professional environment!
    
I have worked for companies where I as told it wasn't worth for me to setup environment, thus could not contribute to the product.

<center><h2>Install Anaconda</h2></center>

- Follow these directions for macOS __graphical__ install [docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os)
- Python 3.8 version
- Skip PyCharm installation

<center><h2>Setting-up GitHub</h2></center>

Use GitHub like Dropbox for now, except it will require manual syncing.

You'll just download files that I post. Later we'll use it how a professional coder use it.

1. Open a web browser to https://github.com/brianspiering/computation_course
1. Click on green code button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop Option"
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if prompted
1. If you don't how to navigate the file system, put everything on desktop.


<center><h2>FAQs</h2></center>

- I have Python 3.7 installed. What should I do?
    + You need to uninstall Python 3.7. Download and install the current version Anaconda which is Python 3.8. All of the faculty are using Python 3.8.
- I installed Python with homebrew. What should I do?
    + You need to uninstall Python via homebrew. Install Python only through Anaconda.
- What about environments (e.g., `conda env` or `virtualenv`)?  
    + The faculty has decided that environments are unnecessary complex for the first set of courses and the program is not using them. We suggest everyone not use environments, aka everything will be in `base` environment.
