When you start working as a Data Scientist it can take more than a __full__ day to setup a professional environment!
    
I have worked for companies where I as told it wasn't worth for me to setup environment, thus could not contribute to the product.

<center><h2>Install Anaconda</h2></center>

Use GitHub like Dropbox for now, except it will require manual syncing.

You'll just download files that I post. Later we'll use it how a professional coder use it.

1. Click on green code button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop Option"
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if prompted
1. If you don't how to navigate the file system, put everything on desktop.

<center><h2>Poll</h2></center>

Go to Paricpants section of Zoom:

❌ Something is __broken__ with one of three items.

◀️ You are waiting for something to download or install.

<center><h2> Questions?</h2></center>

1. Since this not an assignment for the course, you are free to Google for the answers.
