Setup vs Running
=======


Setup
-----

- Setup needs to be once.
- You don't need to be good at setup or understand it. Just muddle your way through. If stuck for any reason, ask Brian.
- Setup can be difficult. It requires following the directions __exactly__.

Running
-----

- Running needs to be done every time.
- You need to be fluent at running so it becomes automatic. It is helpful to understand each step so you can debug it yourself.
- Running your setup should be easy / frictionless.
