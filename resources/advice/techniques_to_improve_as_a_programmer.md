Techniques to improve as a programmer
------

> Do not be the person who has practiced 10,000 things once, but be the person who has practiced one thing 10,000 times.

1. Write a lot of code. Physically type code and run it. (if either part is missing it is good code practice)
1. Think of coding practice as a portfolio. It should be a mix:
    - 40-60% Easy-for-you fundamentals. Practicing Pythonic idioms to solve common atomic problems. This develops fluency to solve novel challenges and build up to more advanced coding.
    - 20-30% Difficult-but-possible problems. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and similar is good for this
    - 5-10% Impossible-for-you-right-now code. This could be advanced concepts in Python, learning another language, or fundamental Computer Science concepts
1. Brian's Method
    1. Try a problem without any resources.
    1. If stuck, just look at documentation to get unstuck.
    1. Look-up a collection of great solutions.
    1. Reflect, synthesis, and refactor into a solution that is uniquely your own.
    1. Make a flashcard and drill over time until [over- learned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlearning).
1. Cover Method
    1. Watch great programmer actually program (e.g., [Joel Grus live-coding playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoelGrus/playlists)).
    1. Type along with them. 
    2. Later apply Brian's Method to the same problem.
