Course Description
----

This course is part of the [MS in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science) and is specifically designed as a catalyst to improve computer programming skills for those who are not yet skilled programmers. The course will focus on the applied computer programming concepts and skills directly related to data science.

Writing software is about problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, computer languages, libraries, software tools, and computing devices. In this course, I'm going to teach you how to approach programming, review the key elements of Python, teach you how to leverage Python to solve data science problems, introduce you to the command line, and finally introduce you to cloud computing. You'll go deeper into fundamental data structures and algorithms later in the MSDS program in courses that specifically cover those topics.
